A set of tutorials have been created with the purpose of helping to understand how to create DAS data sources with !MyDas.


= Prerequisites =

To create a !MyDas server and therefore to follow the tutorials, you should ensure that you have the following installed and configured on your computer:

  * Sun Java SDK 1.5 (or later) available from http://java.sun.com
  * Ensure the JAVA_HOME environment variable is set correctly and JAVA_HOME/bin is included in your PATH environment variable.  Run `java -version` to ensure that the correct version of Java is available on the command line.
  * Maven 2 Project Management / Build tool available from http://maven.apache.org/
  * View the [http://maven.apache.org/download.html#installation Instructions for downloading and installing Maven 2] to ensure that you have a complete setup.  Run `mvn --version` on the command line to ensure that Maven 2 is correctly installed.
