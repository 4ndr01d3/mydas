= Introduction =

In this tutorial we will explain how to create a reference data source that implements other capabilities included in DAS but that are optional, and because of that have been ignored in the other tutorials.

= A reference Server =

!MyDas also allows to implement a data source that provides the sequence as a reference for other data sources, including itself because in !MyDas a reference server it is by inheritance an annotation data source.

= 'entry points' Capability =

Some times it is important to provide the ids of the complete segments that can be accessed in a data source. This is specially remarkable for reference servers, in order to bring an easy way to let the user/client to know what can be found in this data source. Usually the entry points are the Uniprot ids for protein data sources and chromosomes/contigs/genes for genomic data sources

= 'maxbins' Capability =

When
