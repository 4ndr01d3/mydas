= !MyDas Tutorial - Other Capabilities =

In this tutorial we will explain how to create a reference data source that implements other capabilities included in DAS but that are optional, and because of that have been ignored in the other tutorials.

== A reference Server ==

!MyDas also allows to implement a data source that provides the sequence as a reference for other data sources, including itself because in !MyDas a reference server it is by inheritance an annotation data source.

== 'entry points' Capability ==

Some times it is important to provide the ids of the complete segments that can be accessed in a data source. This is specially remarkable for reference servers, in order to bring an easy way to let the user/client to know what can be found in this data source. Usually the entry points are the Uniprot ids for protein data sources and chromosomes/contigs/genes for genomic data sources

== 'maxbins' Capability ==

Often a DAS client is limited to display a number of features when in reality a segemnt can have a lot more; think for example, in a client displaying the chromosome 1 and wanted to show its genes as its annotations, there are around 4200 genes in this chromosome, a popular screen configuration have 1280x1024 pixeles, therefore it is phisically impossible to draw all the genes in the same track for this chormosome.
The DAS capability *maxbins* allow to request a X number of the most representative features in a segment.
The problem is that just the owner of the data source can define what 'representative' means for their data.
